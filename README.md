# Model Architecture
Our recommender system leverages the ResNet50 architecture, renowned for its excellence in image classification tasks. This enables accurate and efficient fashion item recommendations.
# About this project:
A. Employed the ResNet50 transfer learning model to derive distinctive features from the images.

B. Implemented the K Nearest Neighbor algorithm to identify similar images and provide recommendations based on any given input image.

c. Utilized the Streamlit library to craft a user-friendly and interactive web application.
